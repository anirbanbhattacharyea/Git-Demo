### __How to install git?__
Visit the git scm [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the correct version depending on your OS.
- [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Linux / Unix](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
- [macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

Verify that the installation is successful by running this command in your terminal / command prompt / powershell:
```bash
git --version
```
If the installation was successful, then the currently installed version will be displayed, else an error will be displayed. If you face any issues during installation, kindly raise an issue.

### Configure git to use with Github and similar platforms
If you don't have a GitHub account yet, you can create it [here](https://www.github.com). Run the following commands to set up your git configuration to use your name and e-mail when you make changes and commits to the repository.
```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your email'
```
Now when you make any commits all the git based platforms will attribute the changes to you and your email.

### Initialize a folder with git
Inside the folder where your source code and related files are located, run:
```bash
git init -b main
```
Once you have run the command, a new folder named `.git` will created inside your directory which will keep all the files related to source control.

### Tracking files
Once you have initialized your folder with git, you can start tracking your files and start making changes without worrying about your currently stable version.

When you first create a new file, it is marked as untracked. Once you have written something you need to stage the file and send it to the 'staging area'. You can do this in one of the following ways.
- Stage all files at once:
```bash
git add .
```
- Stage only selected files:
```bash
git add filename filename ... filename
```

After adding the files to the staging area, it's now time to commit these changes. Commit is time when git takes a snapshot our code and keeps it in it's database. It is always a good practice to not make commits that have very large modifications and to accompany each commit with a message.

Everything that is in the staging area will be commited. There are two ways to create a commit depending on the message you want to accompany with it.
- If the commit has some very minor patches or fixes, you can commit in this format
```bash
git commit -m 'Your message here'
```
- If you want to include a multi line commit with heading and description, then simply write
```bash
git commit
```
This will open a text editor where you can write your commit message in this format.


    Heading

    Start your description from here
    - Point 1
    - Point 2
    - Point 3

### Adding our repository to Github
Once we have made some commits to our repository on our local machine, we can upload it to any web hosted git repository platforms and track our code in the cloud and collaborate with other people. Here's how to add your local repo to GitHub.
- Create a new repository in GitHub.
- Do not initialize it with README or .gitignore.
- Once the repository is created in github, run these commands based on your repository and settings.
```bash
git remote add origin  <REMOTE_URL> 
# Sets the new remote
git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
git push origin main
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you 
# specified as the origin
```
